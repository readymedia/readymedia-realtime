Now we have started transcription in ChromaKey, and we have actually a black border around the white text. This also looks completely wild, if we go full screen it works too. There is a little cut at the end of the text, which I am a little unsure about. And it also looks like it wants to give four lines of text before it jumps forward. A little unsure about... one, two, three, four, yes, so now it has written four lines . Yeah, one, two, three, and then start over again, and create a new one at the top again. Yeah, so that was a little weird maybe, but we can try to talk a little further. I am talking in Norwegian, but it is really cool that I can get English text right out, and it is ChromaKey. It is exactly what we need, actually, if I have had this for a year. I am sure I would have been completely naked in my trousers. But there is something weird with... I will show you the text. And I can actually change it on the way here. Go to Light Team and Dark Team. Light Team. I can live change the text, and I can still live do this. But the Scroll and Fade button, that and the bottom thing doesn't work yet.
