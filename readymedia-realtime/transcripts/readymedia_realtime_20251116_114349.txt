Yes, we are currently English, so we're testing and the full screen long seems to be working as it should. We are also trying to speak a little bit so we can get all the lines into and see how it's playing out. We can go full screen. So now we have three lines and we're continuing down on the fourth line, which seems to be working pretty well. It seems to be mid screen. I'm a little bit unsure if we should let all the lines go down to the bottom of the screen because it might look a little bit messy with all the old text there. But maybe we should try to limit the amount of lines a little bit more on the long and probably not use the lines further down. Currently it's working itself down the line, so that's what we are trying to do. Now I'm trying to speak Norwegian here and then it's translating. So when it's gone a little bit, it seems that it locks on the language and then it actually can translate. So when I speak English, I've chosen English and done that in big, so it starts to speak Norwegian, then it actually becomes Norwegian. So there is one thing there that I don't understand in AP. Now it jumps and misses a lot of the lines for some reason. It shouldn't do that on long, it's short that should do that. This should just continue down here, actually. I'm not sure what's happening there. But line shift, how does that work? No, I can't do that, I can't create a direct command, but now it continues down. And it looks like it's quite good in terms of how far down on the screen it does it, but it missed it. So now I'm going to try to see what happens when it misses the cursor or something like that, because now I've continued to speak and it's quite long. I'm going to continue working here, one, two, three. Here we see, I take a screenshot here. So what happens there? And then we load it in cursor. Like that, one, two, three. But I think it's quite good, I'm going to start playing with that now. Yes. So then I choose long screen short. So we send less text on the screen. But short. So then we can have the text a little bit bigger. We can have it up to 64 and the distance is 1, 3. Full screen, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. I have 9 lines now. And then it starts a little bit new again after that. We have 1, 2, 3, 4 lines and then we talk a little further. So we see what it does for something then.
